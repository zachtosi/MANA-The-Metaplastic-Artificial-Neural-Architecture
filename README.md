MANA: The Metaplastic Artificial Neural Architecture
=========================================================

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a MANA network and a SORN (Self-Organizing Recurrent Network). It is uncertain at the time of writing how much more general this software will be made. The code runs on GPUs courtesy of arrayfire. 

It is currently not in a working state! Check back soon as the first stable code will be in the repo within the next month.
