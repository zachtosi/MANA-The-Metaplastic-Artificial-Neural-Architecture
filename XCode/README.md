# ArrayFire XCode Template Projects

The projects are set up to pick up ArrayFire using either `usr/local`
installation path, or using the `AF_PATH` variable in XCode. If you have used
a custom install location for ArrayFire, set the AF_PATH variable in `XCode ->
Project -> Build Settings` and search for `AF_PATH`.

The projects also have preset locations for runtime load paths.
